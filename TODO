* Filter unwanted messages

Polling mode now at least filters _some_ messages, but not all.

Ideally we should be able to define "what kind of messages we don't care" then
don't collect them when dumping the result.  E.g. when --quiet enabled, we can
see messages like this when quits:

         "name": "smp_call_function_many_cond",
         "count": 1,
         "funcptr": "do_flush_tlb_all",
         "stack": [
             "smp_call_function_many_cond+0x1",
             "smp_call_function+0x39",
             "on_each_cpu+0x2a",
             "flush_tlb_kernel_range+0x48",
             "__purge_vmap_area_lazy+0x70",
             "_vm_unmap_aliases.part.42+0xdf",
             "__vunmap+0x11d",
             "bpf_jit_binary_free+0xd",
             "bpf_jit_free+0x28",
             "process_one_work+0x18f",
             "worker_thread+0x30",
             "kthread+0x15d",
             "ret_from_fork+0x35"
         ]

* Filter messages triggered at the start of RT app

When RT application starts, it could trigger things like vmstat_update which is
legal.  It'll become illegal when RT workload starts.

Need some facility to filter those ones too.
